\question
This is my answer to the first question.

Don't forget to fill in your personal and class information at the top!

\question
This question's number will be auto-incremented.

\lipsum[2]

\question+{Super Fancy Named Question}
This question was given a fancy name!

\question*{Also Super Fancy Named Question}
This question also have a fancy name but not in bold text.

\question
Using the \texttt{induction} environment is a great way to typeset induction proofs!
\begin{induction}
  \basecase
  Here I have my base case.
  This is usually about 1-2 lines of text that is not entirely difficult to come up with.
  That doesn't mean it's not important though!
  \indhyp
  Assume cool things to make proof work. Look, math:
  \[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]
  \indstep
  Prove all the things.  When in doubt, write in Latin, because things
  written in Latin sound more true.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
  adipiscing elit. Maecenas tempor risus in dapibus aliquam. Donec at
  euismod dui. In libero turpis, blandit quis vestibulum ac, rutrum sit amet
  est. Suspendisse nec lacus vel dui lobortis lacinia at sit amet risus.
  Fusce dui ex, imperdiet nec finibus ut, bibendum a lacus.
\end{induction}

Therefore, we have proven the claim by induction in the \texttt{induction} environment.

\question
Use the arabicparts environment to include the questionCounter number in the list.
\begin{arabicparts}
  \questionpart Use \LaTeX
  \questionpart ???
  \questionpart Profit!
\end{arabicparts}

\lipsum[7]

\question
Use the alphaparts environment for letters instead of numbers.
\begin{alphaparts}
  \questionpart
  Use \LaTeX
  \questionpart ???
  \questionpart Profit!
\end{alphaparts}

\question
Question part numbers are auto-incremented within the same question, so if you have some question parts...

\begin{alphaparts}
  \questionpart
  Use \LaTeX
  \questionpart ???
\end{alphaparts}

Followed by some additional text, followed by some more question parts:

\begin{alphaparts}
  \questionpart Profit!
\end{alphaparts}

All parts will be continuously numbered.

\question
Question numbers continue to auto-increment, regardless of question type.

\lipsum[4]

% Use \renewcommand{\questiontype}{<text>} to change what word is displayed
% before numbered questions
\renewcommand{\questiontype}{Task}
\question
This question has a different question type!

\lipsum[5]

\renewcommand{\questiontype}{Question}

\question
You can still do things like nesting lists inside of these environments.
\begin{alphaparts}
  \questionpart Use \LaTeX
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Open terminal
    \item Open vim
    \item Write LaTeX
  \end{enumerate}
  \questionpart ???
  \questionpart Profit!
\end{alphaparts}

\lipsum[9]

% Use the \setcounter{questionCounter}{<x>} to force the question number to a
% particular question. If your written homework's question start at number 9001,
% use the following
\setcounter{questionCounter}{9000}
\question

\section{}
You can also use the \texttt{section} macro for starting a question.

\lipsum[10]

\section*{Using the \texttt{section} Macro}
The starred \texttt{section*} works as well.

\lipsum[11]

\question*{Using \texttt{minted} to make code block}
Minted use python package \texttt{pygments} to colour the text, don't forget to install them.

Also use \texttt{-shell-escape} argument when compile.

\definecolor{codebg}{rgb}{0.95, 0.95, 0.95}
\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor=codebg]{python}
  #comments!
  def foo():
    print("Hi mom!")
\end{minted}
